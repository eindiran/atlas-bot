# atlas-bot
The goal of AtlasBot is to build a simple to manage, yet configurable IRC bot. It is currently a WIP, in part to allow me to try out Haskell and to get a feel for the IRC specification.

The final version of AtlasBot will allow a number of simple actions to be performed by sending the bot a message. It will then conditionally executed the commands based on your status in the channel. The bot will take a small YAML file as a configuration file.
